# FighterFoundation2.0
So I am restarting my repo of FF, with a bunch of new tools. This is going to be my first project using React, and ViteJS in replacement for Webpack, TailwindCSS, and Prettier. 
React is not too daunting looking at the documentation and guide as it is just HTML markup mixed with JS. I like that a lot. Some simple syntax can be gotten used too fast. I have been holding back on this project until I got to this
point and I am excited to start working and doing the best I can for this great organization.
